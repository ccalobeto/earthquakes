			<h1>Earthquakes in Perú</h1>
			<h3>The visualization shows all the Earthquakes that had more than 5.5M of intensity since 1960 and labelling the
				ones
				greater than 7.8M. The intensity
				scale reached by an
				earthquake is called <b>Moment Magnitude (M)</b>
				and it is represented by the area of the circle. The color which is lighter or darker represents how deep was
				the event.

				<br>The destructive power between consecutive scales is 31.6 times more. Say an earthqueake of 7M is 31.6 more
				powerfull than a 6M. An 8M earthquake is 31.6 x 31.6 ≈ <b>1,000</b> times more powerful than a 6M!</br>
