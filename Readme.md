# üåã Earthquakes in Peru Visualization Project

Hey there! Welcome to my earthquake visualization project for Per√∫. This interactive tool helps you explore seismic activity throughout Per√∫ using the power of d3.js, CSS, and HTML.

>[!WARNING]
> We edited dates of last 5 rows in `IGP_datos_sismicos-historical.csv` to fix formatting issues.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Want to clone and run this project? Just follow these simple steps:

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone [repository-url]
cd earthquakes

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the visualization
npm run dev
```

## üîç Stages of the Project

### Stage 1: Data Preparation

Getting fresh earthquake data? No problem!

1. Download the latest data from [IGP (Instituto Geof√≠sico del Per√∫)](https://ultimosismo.igp.gob.pe/descargar-datos-sismicos)
2. Move the CSV files to the `./data/` directory (keep the original filenames)
3. Run our data processing script:
   ```sh
   npm run prepare-data
   ```

### Stage 2: Data Transformation 

Behind the scenes, our code is doing some cool stuff:

- Converting geographical coordinates into formats compatible with d3.geo and turf
- Finding the nearest district for earthquakes located in the sea (since the IGP data doesn't include city/district names)
- Calculating distances between earthquake locations and district centroids
- Merging historical and recent earthquake data for a complete timeline

### Stage 3: Visualization Components

Our visualization features:

- Interactive map of Peru showing earthquake locations
- Timeline visualization of seismic activity
- Filtering options by magnitude and time periods
- Color-coded representation of earthquake intensity

## üî¢ Understanding Earthquake Magnitude

Curious about those numbers? Here's what they mean:

- **Magnitude**: Measured on the Richter scale, it tells us the energy released by an earthquake
- **< 4.0**: Minor shaking, rarely causes damage
- **4.0-5.9**: Can cause moderate damage to vulnerable structures
- **6.0-6.9**: Can be destructive in populated areas
- **7.0+**: Major earthquake causing serious damage across large areas
- **8.0+**: Great earthquake that can totally destroy communities near the epicenter

Our visualization uses color coding to help you quickly identify the severity of each earthquake event.
